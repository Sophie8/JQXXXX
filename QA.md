# Guidlines

* Every non-trivial question asked online should be documented here.  
* The questioner should pay attention to the dicussion, make a thorough summary of the answers and add his/her name for reference later.
* If the question remains open-ended, the questioner should add the question to the doc, together with a hashtag #OPEN#.
* The group leader will check the doc weekly and get the teaching assistant involved to answer the open-ended questions.
